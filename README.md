# Coachable Student Github Template 
A template repository that Coachable students will use in the program for Leetcode and other assignments.


## Instructions to setup student repositiory
- On the top right of the main page of this repository, click on `Use this template` and `Create a new repository` on your Github account.
- Follow the convention for the naming of the repo: 
  - `Coachable-[First Name]-[Last Name]-Repository`
- (Optional) Make the newly created repository private.
- Add your these list of coaches (link TBA) as collaborators to your private forked repository, granting access for review and feedback.
  - Example: https://stackoverflow.com/a/64682846/24669812
- [IMPORTANT] Replace the coach in [`.github/CODEOWNERS`](https://github.com/Coachable-Dev/coachable-student-github-template/blob/main/.github/CODEOWNERS#L1) with your designated coach. This will ensure timely notifications when a Pull Request (PR) is made.


## Leetcode Code submission instructions 
- Commit messages must be the Leetcode problem, so that includes the problem number and problem title. [Example](https://github.com/Coachable-Dev/coachable-student-github-template/commit/72aca819a24053392f8ea2e93645233093f48450).
- Commits must be made to a seperate branch (a feature branch), and not the main branch. Pull Requests (PRs) will be made to merge into the main branch. This will allow coaches to review your code and submissions. [Example](https://github.com/Coachable-Dev/coachable-student-github-template/commits/2024-11-13-submission).
- PR messages must include the leetcode problem number, loom link, and 2 - 3 word sentence summary.
  - If there are multiple commits(problems) per PR, then the PR must segment each Loom link and problem summary by Problem number using proper markdown (i.e. using separators in markdown to separate problems.)
